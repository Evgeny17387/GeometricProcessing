Explanation: the first structure is the vertices (coordinates) and the second structure is the faces (triangles - 3 vertices)

2) Show screenshots of the provided meshes with each connected component colored differently. Show the number of connected components and the size of each component (measured in number of faces) for all the provided models.






3) Show screenshots of the subdivided meshes.

4) Show screenshots of face extrusion.

5) Show a screenshot of a mesh you designed yourself starting from 'cube.off' and using the GUI supplied editing operations, as well as sqrt3 subdivision and face extrusion. Make sure to also save the mesh under the name 'design.off', commit and push it.
